**Connected Concept Analysis for Python**

This notebook helps with doing Connected Concept Analysis in Python. It does (roughly) the same job as [Textometrica](httpa://github.com/simonlindgren/textometrica2023).

For a description of CCA, refer to this paper:

>Lindgren, S. (2016). "Introducing Connected Concept Analysis: A network approach to big text datasets". Text & Talk: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Language, Discourse & Communication Studies 36(3): 341â€“362. [https://doi.org/10.1515/text-2016-0016]

CCA is a workflow for combining manual thematic coding with a form of network text analysis.
